# Crazy-Ball

My first ever Android application that dates back in June 2014 when I was 17. This was my high-school graduation project. This is a game represented with a ball that is falling towards the ground. The fall is interrupted by horizontal obstacles that have different speed. The player's goal was to have the ball step on many obstacles as possible for 60 seconds. The game was called "CrazyBall."
